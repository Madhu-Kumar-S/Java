package - represents a directory / folder that contains a group of classes and interfaces

eg: import java.io.*;
java - represents directory
io - sub directory
* - includes all the classes and interfaces within that sub directory

library - group of packages

2 types:
1. Built-in packages - these packages are already available in java language.
can be imported anywhere in the packages

2. User-defined packages - users can create their own package
can be imported in other classes

To create a user-defined package:
package packageName;
package packageName.SubPackageName;


Access Specifiers:
(4 types) - private, public, protected, default.
we do not use default access specifier, if we did not use any access specifier
to the member, then java compiler will take that member as default.

private:
scope is limited only where it is defined - can access only within the class
i.e., class scope

public:
scope is available anywhere - can access anywhere in any package
i.e., global scope

protected:
scope is limited within package +
scope is limited outside of the package
only if the class in another package is sub class of the super class in any other package
it acts as a public with respect to sub classes

default:
scope is limited within the package - can access only within the package
i.e., package scope


API documentation:
API - application programming interface - an html file
that contains the description of all the features of the software/product/technology.
- a reference manual that is useful for all the users to understand the features and use them.

Java soft people created api for SE, EE and ME.

how to create API doc?
copy all the source code(.java) files into a separate directory
then use documentation comments(/**......*/) where ever necessary
run-> javadoc *.java
then html file gets created.
