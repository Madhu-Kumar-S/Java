Interface is a specification of method prototype.
-All the methods of the interfaces are public and abstract by default.
-can have 0 methods.
-Not possible to create an object to the interface.
-declared with keyword 'interface'
-applicable only to classes.
-methods in interface should be implemented in subclasses (implementation classes).

 Interface methods are public since it should be available to 3rd party vendors to provide implementation.
 They are abstract too because their implementation is left for third party vendors.

API (Application programming interface) document - an html document that provides
a description about the program.

how 3rd party vendors know which method to implement?
programmers will be providing API doc to the 3rd party vendors.

Interface can have variables of public static and final by default.
so all variables are constant.

--An interface is a specification of method prototypes.
This means, only method names are written in the interface without method bodies.

--An interface will have 0 or more abstract methods
which are all public and abstract by default.
An interface can have variables which are public static and final by default.
This means all the variables of the interface are constants.

--None of the methods in an interface can be private, protected or static.
We cannot create an object to an interface,
but we can create a reference of interface type.

--All the methods of an interface should be implemented in its implementation classes.
If any method is not implemented, then that implementation class
should be declared as 'abstract.

--Interface reference can refer to the objects of its implementation classes.
When an interface is written, any third party vendor can provide implementation classes

--An interface can extend another interface.

--An interface cannot implement another interface.
It is possible to write a class within an interface.

--Interface forces the implementation classes to implement all of its methods compulsory.
 Java compiler checks whether all the methods are
 implemented in the implementation classes or not.

Callback - a mechanism of calling a function from another function
 by passing its memory address. can be achieved by interface.
