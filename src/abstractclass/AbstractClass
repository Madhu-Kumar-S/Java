Abstract class - An abstract class is a class that contains zero or more abstract methods.

Abstract methods - abstract method is a method without method body (contains only method header)
                   defined inside the abstract class
                   declared in the subclasses.
                   abstract methods are written when the same method has to perform different tasks
                   depending upon the object calling it.
                   an incomplete methods.

Both are declared using abstract keyword

It is not possible to create to an object to the abstract classes because,
since the abstract class contains abstract methods that are incomplete
so it is not possible for JVM to estimate the total memory required to create th object.

we should create subclass and implement the abstract methods in it
and can create objects to the subclasses.

It is not possible to create to an object to the abstract classes
but we can create a reference variable to it, as it does not occupy any memory.

concrete method - method with body

Abstract class can also contain instance variables and concrete methods in addition to abstract methods.

The keyword abstract represents incomplete, so when used with class it is compulsory to create subclass
to the abstract class for implementation.

final cannot used with abstract class/method as it is contradictory.
since final prevents class inheritance and method overloading.
