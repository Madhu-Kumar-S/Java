Wrapper class:
- a field that stores the primitive DT
- conversion of primitive DT into object types (i.e., wrapping Primitive value into object)
- used in collection classes where it handles only objects

=> so wrapper class is a class that converts primitive type into object type
where it is needed in the internet to communicate bw two apps
=> classes in java.util package uses only objects so wrapper classes are needed for handling them

Number is an abstract class whose sub packages are Byte, Short, Integer, Long, Float, Double
so methods of Number classes are commonly available in sub classes

Character obj = Character.valueOf('A');
Integer obj = Integer.valueOf(1);
Float obj = Float.valueOf(2.3f);

when two objects are compared
if equal returns 0
if greater returns +ve value
if Lesser returns -ve value

boxing - converting primitive data type into object type
unboxing - converting object type into primitive data type
