to store a group of elements we can use array
to store a group of objects?
yes we can use same array to store group of objects

But the thing that is:
1.array cannot grow dynamically.
which means when an array is created and its size is fixed,
and at runtime its size cannot be increased and decreased
2.array stores only elements that belongs to the same datatype and objects that belongs to the same class type.
3.Adding the elements is easy but inserting or deleting the elements at the mid of the array is difficult
4.no methods to carry out for processing the data after retrieving.

to overcome these problems, there is an alternative solution
by using an object to store the other group of objects
we can use class object as an array
such object is called Collection Objects or Container objects.

Collection Objects or Container objects is an object which can store a group of other objects.
a collection object has an class called 'Collections or Container class' and these classes are contained in java.util package
Collection objects stores the references of other objects into a collection object.

A Collection Framework is a group of collection classes or a class library to handle group of objects.
They are implemented in java.util package.

All the collection classes in java.util package are the implementation classes of different interfaces

InterFace Type                          Implementation Classes

1. Set<T>                               HasSet<T>
                                        LinkedHashSet<T>

2. List<T>                              Stack<T>
                                        LinkedList<T>
                                        ArrayList<T>
                                        Vector<T>

3. Queue<T>                             LinkedList<T>

4. Map<K,V>                             HasMap<K,V>
                                        HashSet<K,V>

T -> Generic type parameter (String, Integer, Float, Double, etc...)

Sets:
Set represents a group of elements just like an array.
Set grows dynamically in size.
Set will not allow duplicate elements

Lists:
Similar to set
List allow duplicate elements

Queues:
Stores and process elements in FIFO Order.

Maps:
Stores elements in form of Key-Value pairs.
Key should be unique.
If key is provided then corresponding value is obtained.

Collections does not store primitive DT.

Retrieving elements from collections:

1. using for-each loop:

2. using Iterator Interface:

3. using ListIterator Interface:

4. using Enumeration Interface:
