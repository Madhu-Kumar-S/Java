It is also possible to pass data from one object to another in chained form
for doing this, there are 3 ways to relate objects in java

1 -> using references (i.e objects)
2 -> using inner class concept
3 -> using inheritance

Inner classes:
A class declared inside another class
inner classes is a safety mechanism becoz it is hidden from outer classes
private access specifier can be used for inner classes for providing security
object to inner classes cannot be created outside,
it can be created inside the class which it is declared (i.e outer class)
inner class can access members of the class where it is declared

important notes:
Outer class members can be referred as Outerclassname.this.member; inside inner classes where it is declared.
inner class can access the outer class members directly.
inner class and outer class objects are created seperate memory locations.
Inner class object contains an additional invisible field 'this$0' that refers to its outer class object.
